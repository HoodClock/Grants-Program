DOT: (Provide Polkadot address)

USDC: (Provide Polkadot AssetHub address)

Level: 2

Project Overview
Overview
Tagline: "Predict the Risk. Prevent the Loss." — A transaction simulator shielding users from scams, failed TXs, and gas waste.

Description: TxShield previews transactions, estimates gas, and flags risks (e.g., honeypots) using Ethers.js + Next.js. Targets 21M+ MetaMask users to cut $103M+ annual scam losses.

Polkadot Integration: Plans to extend simulation to Polkadot’s EVM (Moonbeam) and ink! smart contracts.

Team Interest: Built MVP after witnessing $100K+ user losses to blind transactions.

Project Details
MVP: safe-tx-simulator.vercel.app | GitHub

Tech Stack:

Frontend: Next.js/React

Backend: Node.js/Ethers.js

Detection: Custom bytecode analysis

Limitations:

Not a wallet (integrates with existing ones).

Scam detection accuracy currently ~90% (improving with beta data).

Ecosystem Fit
Audience: Wallet developers (MetaMask, Talisman), Polkadot parachains, end users.

Need: 30% of Ethereum TXs fail; scams drain millions yearly. TxShield prevents losses pre-execution.

Uniqueness: Combines simulation, gas estimation, and scam detection (vs. standalone tools like Tenderly).
