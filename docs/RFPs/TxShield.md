_**Project Description 📄✨**_

Why TxShield?

TxShield is a transaction simulation platform shielding Web3 users from pitfalls like failed transactions, high gas fees, and honeypot scams—costing Ethereum users $103M+ from 2018–2024 (per scam reports). Using Ethers.js and Next.js, it previews transactions, nails gas estimates, and flags risks (e.g., “High Gas Fees Detected: Possible Honeypot!”). It empowers 21M+ MetaMask users to transact safely, cutting losses and building trust.


Why It’s Useful 🌟:

Ethereum Ecosystem: Tackles failed txns ($100K lost once) and scams, aligning with Web3 Foundation’s safety goals 🛡️
Cross-Chain Potential: Supports Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism (Sepolia, Chain ID: 11155111), with Polkadot plans 🚀
Developer Utility: Open-source (MIT) at github.com/HoodClock/SafeTxSimulator for safer dApps 🌐

**Impact Goals 🎯:**

Prevent $1M in scam losses yearly 
Save $50K in gas fees for beta users 
Boost Web3 trust for 50K+ users 



**Why TxShield? 🌟**

Unlike basic wallet tools, TxShield delivers simulation, precise costing, and scam detection—all open-source for max impact!


**Predict the Risk. Prevent the Loss. 🔐**
Every day, crypto users lose millions to honeypot scams, malicious contracts, and preventable transaction failures. TxShield stops the bleeding—simulating risks before they become losses.

We’re not just building a tool—we’re rewriting crypto’s weakest link: blind transactions.

With your support, we can turn:
⚠️ "I got scammed" → ✅ "TxShield warned me"
⚠️ "My tx failed" → ✅ "I optimized it first"

Let’s make safe transactions the new standard.
The future of Web3 starts with trust by default.
